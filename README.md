# Pages Plugins

## Features

- ü•û **Completely composable**

  You can include multiple Plugins, Plugins can rely on other Plugins, and they all share the same loading interface.

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Author a Plugin as a folder of Functions**

  The straight-forward syntax and intuitive file-based routing we've developed for Functions can be used to write Plugins.

- üì• **Simple loading mechanism for including Plugins in projects**

  Mount the Plugin wherever you want and optionally pass it data.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Plugins can bring static assets**

  We hide static assets behind an inaccessible URL so they'll only be available in user-land where the Plugin exposes them.

## Usage
